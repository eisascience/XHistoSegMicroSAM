# Contributing to XHalo Path Analyzer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to XHalo Path Analyzer! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Welcome newcomers and help them get started
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Assume good intentions

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

1. Check if the bug has already been reported in [Issues](https://github.com/eisascience/XHaloPathAnalyzer/issues)
2. If not, create a new issue with:
 - Clear title and description
 - Steps to reproduce
 - Expected vs actual behavior
 - Environment details (OS, Python version, etc.)
 - Screenshots if applicable

### Suggesting Features

1. Check existing issues and discussions
2. Create a new issue with:
 - Clear use case description
 - Expected behavior
 - Why this feature would be useful
 - Possible implementation approach (optional)

### Contributing Code

1. **Fork the repository**

2. **Create a feature branch**
 ```bash
 git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
 ```

3. **Make your changes**
 - Follow the coding standards (see below)
 - Add tests for new functionality
 - Update documentation as needed

4. **Test your changes**
 ```bash
 pytest tests/ -v
 python examples/basic_usage.py
 ```

5. **Commit your changes**
 ```bash
 git commit -m "Add feature: your feature description"
 ```

 Use conventional commits:
 - `feat:` for new features
 - `fix:` for bug fixes
 - `docs:` for documentation changes
 - `test:` for test additions/changes
 - `refactor:` for code refactoring

6. **Push to your fork**
 ```bash
 git push origin feature/your-feature-name
 ```

7. **Create a Pull Request**
 - Provide a clear description
 - Reference related issues
 - Wait for review

## Coding Standards

### Python Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Maximum line length: 100 characters
- Use docstrings for functions and classes

### Docstring Format

```python
def function_name(param1: Type1, param2: Type2) -> ReturnType:
 """
 Brief description of function

 Args:
 param1: Description of param1
 param2: Description of param2

 Returns:
 Description of return value

 Raises:
 ExceptionType: When this exception is raised
 """
 pass
```

### Code Organization

- Keep functions focused and small
- Use meaningful variable names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Group related functionality

### Testing

- Write unit tests for new functions
- Maintain or improve test coverage
- Test edge cases
- Use pytest fixtures for setup

Example test:
```python
def test_function_name():
 """Test description"""
 # Arrange
 input_data = create_test_data()

 # Act
 result = function_under_test(input_data)

 # Assert
 assert result == expected_output
```

## Development Setup

1. **Clone and install in development mode**

 **Using uv (Recommended for Mac M2/ARM):**
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/eisascience/XHaloPathAnalyzer.git
 cd XHaloPathAnalyzer

 # Install uv if not already installed
 curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh # or: brew install uv

 # Create virtual environment and install
 uv venv
 source .venv/bin/activate
 uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
 ```

 **Using pip:**
 ```bash
 git clone https://github.com/eisascience/XHaloPathAnalyzer.git
 cd XHaloPathAnalyzer
 pip install -e ".[dev]"
 ```

2. **Install pre-commit hooks (optional)**
 ```bash
 # Using uv
 uv pip install pre-commit
 pre-commit install

 # Or using pip
 pip install pre-commit
 pre-commit install
 ```

3. **Run tests**
 ```bash
 pytest tests/ -v --cov=xhalo
 ```
